In React Native, a subtle bug can occur when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item renderers.  If the item renderer performs expensive operations or makes network requests within the `renderItem` function, it can lead to significant performance issues, especially on lower-end devices. This often manifests as stuttering scrolling, dropped frames, and even app crashes due to memory exhaustion. The root cause is the `FlatList`'s optimization strategy; it tries to reuse components for performance, but if the item renderer is not properly optimized, it can lead to unexpected behavior and data inconsistencies. For example, if the component's state is not properly reset between renders, or if network requests made within the `renderItem` aren't properly managed, the `FlatList` may incorrectly display outdated or inconsistent data.
